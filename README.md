This project enables hiding text within images using Least Significant Bit (LSB) or AES encryption combined with LSB. Users can encode or decode messages securely.

Dependencies: OpenCV (cv2), NumPy (numpy), Tkinter (tkinter), Pillow (PIL), AES (aes), LSB (lsb), Python (python)

Usage:
  1) Choose between LSB or AES + LSB for encoding/decoding.
  2) Select an image and input text/key as required.
  3) Encode or decode messages securely.
  4) Images with hidden data are saved for further use.

Run the script: python app.py
